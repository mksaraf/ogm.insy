What is the purpose of the Premium Recovery Endorsement?,"4. The Premium Recovery Endorsement allows the owner to fully surrender the policy during the premium recovery period and recover all or a portion of the total premiums paid less any policy debt or withdrawals,

attained age of 95, assuming no policy loans are taken. In some instances, additional premium may be required based on underwriting class, table ratings or flat extras.

The endorsement is valid up to the 25-year policy anniversary, provided that the qualification test is met annually, which typically requires that the gross premiums paid are sufficient to guarantee the policy until the insured's age of 95, assuming no loans are taken from the policy.
